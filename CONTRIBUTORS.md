## Personal Reason for Release
i'm Happy that You Are Considering Helping This Project, Since Really the base was a Big Learning Moment For me, But Having This ~Semi-Recreation (of the Xbox One Launch (Metro) Dashboard Which People Miss) Vaulted in my Drive Felt Too Stupid, so i Decided to leave it for the Community to Grow it and Eventually Evolve it into a Unified Launcher That Would Rival the Likes of Playnite and Such
